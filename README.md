# FusionOrphanBodyFinder

A Fusion 360 add-in that finds and fixes "orphan bodies" — loose BRepBodies sitting directly inside components that also contain subcomponents.

## The Problem

In well-organized Fusion 360 designs, every "Body" lives inside its own component. But it's easy to accidentally leave bodies at the wrong level of the hierarchy — for example, a component that has both child subcomponents *and* direct bodies. These "orphan bodies" make it harder to manage visibility, materials, joints, and manufacturing outputs.

This add-in scans your entire design tree, flags every component with orphan bodies, and offers to automatically wrap each one in its own new subcomponent.

## Installation

Download or clone this repository, then copy the `FusionOrphanBodyFinder` folder to your Fusion 360 add-ins directory:

**macOS:**
```
~/Library/Application Support/Autodesk/Autodesk Fusion 360/API/AddIns/
```

**Windows:**
```
%AppData%\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns\
```

Then in Fusion 360:

1. Go to **UTILITIES > ADD-INS** (or press **Shift+S**)
2. Select the **Add-Ins** tab
3. Find **FusionOrphanBodyFinder** in the list and click **Run**

A **"Find Orphan Bodies"** button will appear in the **INSPECT** toolbar panel.

## Usage

1. Click **"Find Orphan Bodies"** in the INSPECT panel
2. A dialog appears with a single option: **Include Root Component** (checked by default). Uncheck this if you want to ignore orphan bodies in the top-level root component. Click **OK**.
3. The add-in scans every component in the design. For each component that has both child occurrences *and* direct bodies, you'll see a prompt:

   > Component 'Bracket Assembly' contains 2 orphan bodies: [Body1, Body2]
   >
   > Move to new subcomponents?

   - **Yes** — For each body, an input box lets you rename it (defaults to the parent component name). The body is then moved into a new child component with that name.
   - **No** — Skip this component and move on to the next.
   - **Cancel** — Stop the entire operation.

4. When finished, a summary message shows how many bodies were moved across how many components.

## What Gets Flagged

| Component contents | Flagged? |
|---|---|
| Only bodies, no subcomponents | No |
| Only subcomponents, no bodies | No |
| Both bodies and subcomponents | **Yes** |

## What "Fix" Does

For each orphan body in a flagged component:

1. Prompts you to name the body (and its new component)
2. Creates a new child component with an identity transform
3. Names the new component after your input
4. Moves the body into the new component via `moveToComponent`

The body's position in 3D space is preserved — only its location in the browser tree changes.
